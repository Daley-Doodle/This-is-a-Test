		<h3>
			Target Audience
		</h3>
		<p>
			The target audience for this game is teenagers and up. This game handles content that isn't appropriate for younger people, since it is a murder mystery with a psychological twist. The society that the main character lives in is also something that a younger mind just probably wouldn't understand either. It is meant to be a society that is seemingly the same as ours, but they have completely gotten rid of crime. How? I can't say because that would ruin the suprise, but the point is that this story has a bit of maturity and depth to it, and thus it needs an audience that can both understand it and then think about it afterwards. I want the audience members to be able to think about this society after their done playing, and wonder what it'd be like if our world went down that path. Which is something I just don't think kids (at least most kids) could do.
