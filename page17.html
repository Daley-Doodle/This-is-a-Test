			You immediately go to the house phone and dial 911. You don’t know exactly what you’ll say when the operator gets on the line, but you can’t handle the situation anymore. Your heart can’t handle it. As the phone begins to ring, your mind starts reeling. Did you really kill the man? Were you someone to be afraid of? What about now, will you go back to being that way when you get your memories back? Will you even get your memories back? Do you want to? What will happen to you when the police come? All these questions are flying around in your head, yet there’s one thing overtaking them all: why do you feel so unsettled? What is this weird feeling you’ve had since you came to consciousness in this strange place?
		</p>
		<p>
			Suddenly, the dialing stops and a voice can be heard on the other side, it shouts the following: “Congratulations! You’ve passed!!”. Passed? Passed what? You ask. “The goodness test, you did the right thing by calling the authorities, now you’ll get a full year of freedom until you have to take the test again, so be proud and have fun!” The line was then cut short. What did he mean by test? What is going on-
		</p>
		<p>
			Seemingly out of nowhere, light floods the house, or at least what used to be a house as a set crew begins to break it down. You are too stunned to even speak, or move for that matter, until you remember the body. Your eyes begin to search for it, but it’s nowhere to be found, until you feel a tap on your shoulder and whip around to see what it is… It’s him. The man! But he was dead? You really begin to panic now. Nothing’s making any sense!!
		</p>
		<p>
			The man grabs you by the shoulder and hands you one of the pictures from before.  “The simulation is over, you can go home now, your husband is waiting for you.” Your husband? Your… husband? And that’s when it finally clicks. Your husband is safe, you didn’t kill him. You passed the goodness test! You’re free to go back home! Without another thought, you do just that.
