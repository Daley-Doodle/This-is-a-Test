			It’s a tight fit, but you manage to squeeze your body through the small opening left in the window, and wind up falling on the other side of it. As you attempt to get up and gather your bearings, you realize multiple things at the same time. One, you couldn’t see anything, as it was darker in the surrounding area even compared to the dimly lit house. Two, the light emanating from the window revealed a structure that was by no means a real house but instead more of a set that you would see in the movies. And finally, three, that there were people approaching, from where you didn’t know but there were many of them.  
		</p>
		<p>
			It’s fine. You abandoned the body, so as long as you act normal no one should be able to suspect a thing, at least that’s what you tell yourself. Suddenly, the room is flooded with light and you’re temporarily blinded as multiple people begin to corner you. Your heart begins to hammer in your chest. You don’t know what’s happening. As soon as your eyes finally adjust to the light you notice that multiple people begin to break down the house, while the others encircle you to prevent you from running. You begin to scream. What is going on? Who are you people? Leave me alone! I just want to live, is that so wrong?! 
		</p>
		<p>
			That’s when a man, the man, walks through the circle and meets you at the center. Your knees begin to buckle. He was dead. You could’ve sworn that he was dead. What is going on? “You believed that you had killed your husband, and yet you attempted to run away, and you have the audacity to think that you have it bad. You failed the goodness test and for that you will be punished”. Goodness test? Punished? But you didn’t do- and that’s when it clicked. You failed the goodness test. You could no longer be free, and you wouldn’t be able to see your husband, at least not for now, but you still have a chance for redemption. It’s not over for you. You can be saved. You just have to take the test again. 
		</p>
		<p>
			“Start the test again”, and with those words the world went dark once again…
			<br/>
			<br/>
			<br/>
			…You come to consciousness suddenly and realize a few things.
