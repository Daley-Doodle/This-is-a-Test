			You are not a bad person. You wouldn’t be doing this if life hadn’t forced you into this position. Running away wasn’t an option, you’re trapped in this house, and calling the police would only make the situation worse seeing as you’re the only living person here. This is the only way to make sure you’re safe, and there is nothing wrong with that… So why does it feel so wrong? What is this feeling of dread, of remorse, that proceeds moments when you know you’re about to go too far. Past the point of no return…
		</p>
		<p>
			It’s too late to think of that now. It’s too late. You get a knife from the kitchen and bend over the body. A feeling of déjà vu comes over you. You’re almost in the position that you were in when you came to consciousness in this strange place, except now you know that you’re not innocent. The strong overhead light that pierced your soul, now burns against your skin as you grip the knife and touch it to the man’s skin. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Suddenly though, you’re being pinned to the floor by the man you presumed to be dead. Your heart rate begins to double and the breath that was just knocked out of your body prevents you from being able to speak coherently. What is going on? He was dead? Nothing is making any sense! “You are under arrest”. What? Why? “You’re asking why? You failed the goodness test and for that you will be punished. You were willing to brutally dismember your own husband to save your own skin. You are disgusting scum of the Earth. People like you are the reason we have this test in the first place!” Test? Your husband? And that’s when it all clicks. You failed the goodness test. You’re life was over. You’d never be able to see your husband again and it was all your fault. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Once again you realized multiple things at the same time…You were a monster. You were the scum of the Earth. And you would rot behind bars till the end of your time…
