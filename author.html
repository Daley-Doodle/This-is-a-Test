			Hi! My name is Daley Eisenmann!!
		</p>
		<p>
			I am in my sophmore year of college at UCF. My major is Digital Media: Game Design major and my minors are in creative writing and computer science. I am an anime nerd and theatre geek who is obsessed with Deku (Izuku Midoriya). I'm also an artist, and some of my artistic hobbies include drawing, crocheting, prop making, wood burning, sewing, and so much more. I'm also an officer for two clubs this year including Anime Spot (Cosplay Vice Director) and Women in Animation (Secretary). This is the first game related project that I've ever actually made, so I hope you enjoy!!
